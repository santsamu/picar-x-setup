# Uninstall Script Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Broken Pipe Errors ❌➜✅
**Problem**: 
```
ERROR: Pipe to stdout was broken
Exception ignored on flushing sys.stdout:
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
```

**Root Cause**: Using `pip3 list | grep -q "$package"` caused broken pipes when grep exited early.

**Solution**: Replaced with `pip3 show "$package" &>/dev/null` which is more reliable and doesn't cause pipe issues.

### 2. Permission Denied Errors ❌➜✅
**Problem**: 
```
rm: cannot remove '/home/sam/robot-hat/robot_hat/__pycache__/...': Permission denied
```

**Root Cause**: Files created during `sudo python3 setup.py install` have root ownership.

**Solution**: Added fallback to use `sudo rm -rf` when regular removal fails.

### 3. Incomplete Package Removal ❌➜✅
**Problem**: Packages installed via `setup.py install` weren't fully removed by pip uninstall.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive cleanup that removes:
- Package directories from site-packages
- .egg-info directories 
- .dist-info directories
- Handles both package name variations (robot-hat vs robot_hat)

## Key Improvements

### Better Error Handling
```bash
# Before: Caused broken pipes
if pip3 list | grep -q "$package"; then

# After: No pipe issues
if pip3 show "$package" &>/dev/null; then
```

### Robust Directory Removal
```bash
# Before: Failed on permission issues
rm -rf "$dir"

# After: Handles permissions gracefully
if ! rm -rf "$dir" 2>/dev/null; then
    log_warning "Permission denied, using sudo to remove $dir..."
    sudo rm -rf "$dir" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

### Comprehensive Package Cleanup
```bash
# Now removes from all Python site-packages locations
python_dirs=$(python3 -c "import site; print(' '.join(site.getsitepackages()))")
for pydir in $python_dirs; do
    # Remove package directories
    sudo rm -rf "$pydir/$package"
    # Remove .egg-info and .dist-info
    sudo rm -rf "$pydir"/*${package}*.egg-info
    sudo rm -rf "$pydir"/*${package}*.dist-info
done
```

### Pre-flight Check
```bash
# Now checks what's installed before attempting removal
check_installation() {
    # Lists found packages, directories, and scripts
    # Exits early if nothing to uninstall
}
```

## Results After Fix

✅ **No broken pipe errors**  
✅ **No permission denied errors**  
✅ **Complete package removal**  
✅ **Clean, informative output**  
✅ **Graceful handling of missing components**

The uninstall script now properly handles all edge cases and completely removes PiCar-X installations regardless of how they were installed.
